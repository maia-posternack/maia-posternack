Hello! My name is Maia Posternack and I am a student at Harvard University studying Applied Math with a Computer Science track. 

Here you can find some of my past projects! I am currently working on RoundTable, a personal finance web-app that allows users to split multiple transactions in an optimized manner. 

I am passionate about finding the intersections between computer science, math, and design, and would love to collaborate.
